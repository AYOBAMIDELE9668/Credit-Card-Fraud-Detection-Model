# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-Model
This project focuses on building **predictive machine learning models** to detect fraudulent transactions in credit card data. The dataset is highly **imbalanced**, with fraud cases making up just **0.172%** of all records. We experiment with multiple classification algorithms, analyze their performance, and explore techniques
